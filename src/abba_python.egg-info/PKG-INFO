# [ABBA](https://biop.github.io/ijp-imagetoatlas/)-Python / Gumby

This repository demoes how to use [ABBA](https://biop.github.io/ijp-imagetoatlas/) with python by using [PyImageJ](https://github.com/imagej/pyimagej) and [JPype](https://github.com/jpype-project/jpype).

# [DeepSlice](https://github.com/PolarBean/DeepSlice)

If you want to register mouse brain sections to the Allen Brain Atlas, ABBA-Python also includes [DeepSlice](https://github.com/PolarBean/DeepSlice), a powerful deep learning tool which can be used for automatic registration of coronal sections of mouse brains. 

DeepSlice is completely independent from ABBA and has been developped by [Harry Carey](https://twitter.com/harrycarey2) and colleagues. Please check [its license](https://github.com/PolarBean/DeepSlice/blob/master/LICENSE) and cite [its preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.28.489953v1?) if you are using it.

### DEEPSLICE IS INDEPENDENT FROM ABBA AND WAS NOT WRITTEN BY THE BIOP

But because of my lack of skills in dependency management in python, copying the code is the only way I found to make it run with ABBA.
